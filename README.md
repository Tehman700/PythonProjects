This is my 1st Project after learning some basic Python Language and it works quite well. Still, there are many changes to be made.
This demonstrates a simple tic-tac-toe game in which we select a point on this 6x6 Matrix and the computer makes the moves. But obviously, it's not AI making moves but kind of makes moves to play easily
Still figuring out many problems to run it efficiently.
BTW, I used (random) module for the computer moves.
